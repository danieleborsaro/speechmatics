A client has asked for a Python script with the following specification:

This script should measure the status of the Speechmatics service every
minute for an hour and print the time(s) when the longest turnaround time
was measured in that period in EST in the format HH:MM:SS.

Documentation on the API call to measure Speechmatics status is here:
https://www.speechmatics.com/api-details#getStatus

The client was delivered some code from one of your colleagues in a different
department.  The client complained that the code is not working.  You are
horrified to see the attached file (measure_turnaround_script.py) is what was
handed over to the client.

Please clean up the code as much as you can in no more than 2 hours so that it
fulfils the original brief as best as possible.  We ask you not to spend more
than 2 hours both because we realise you don't want to spend all your life on a
programming task and also to simulate a very time sensitive client :o)

Once finished please upload your code and a small report on your implementation 
to Github or a similar web-based repository and send us the public url. The
report should be in pdf, markdown or plaintext format.
In your report please comment on what you fixed, what you would do to improve
the code if you had more time and the text with a possible email to send back to
the client with the updated code.
